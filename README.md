# The Ice Cream Truck Rest API built with Ruby on Rails

## About the Project

In this project, I built a REST API, Ice Cream Truck.

- The ice cream truck is selling three types of food items: Ice Creams, Shaved Ice, and Snack bars
- Each one of these food items has a price and a name
- An Ice cream has many flavors. Chocolate, Pistachio, Strawberry and Mint
- The Ice cream truck has a limited amount of Ice creams, Shaved ice and Chocolate bars
- Each time customers buy something, the truck owner should say "ENJOY!"
- If customers try to buy more than what the ice cream truck has in stock, then the ice cream truck owner should respond with "SO SORRY!"

The database has 3 tables and models: Category, Product, and Sale

- Categories table has name, max columns: eg. Ice Creams, Shaved Ice, Snack bars
- Products table has name, price and stock columns: eg. Chocolate, Pistachio, Strawberry, Mint
- Sales table has sold_date and product_id

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.
